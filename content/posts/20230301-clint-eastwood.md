If you're familiar with the band Gorillaz, their debut album has some really popular tracks. One of them being Client Eastwood which had a very distinct melody. I was blown away to see [how that was made](https://twitter.com/LovelyIrishAlan/status/1629058980961042435?t=ThdrxEioizMcj1EdVuMQUw&s=09)... it's cool but also a bit of a letdown.
