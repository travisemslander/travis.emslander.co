I enjoy watching Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) on Youtube. He's a tech youtuber who mostly reviews  computers, phones, and other gadgets. Recently I started listening to a podcast he and his crew created called Waveform. On a recent episode they did a [deep dive into DNS and ICANN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26WvISI14g0) (you can find an audio version of their podcast too) that I found was really helpful to fill in the gaps of why DNS was created and some challenges it's had and how it's worked through it.
