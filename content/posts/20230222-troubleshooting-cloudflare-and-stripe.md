Troy Hunt is the creator of Have I Been PWNED, a service we use at [Field Nation](https://fieldnation.com/) to block logins that use passwords that were exposed in known data breaches. He wrote [this blog posting about an issue he was having](https://www.troyhunt.com/down-the-cloudflare-stripe-owasp-rabbit-hole-a-tale-of-6-rabbits-deep/) related to his use of Stripe for customer billing as well as Cloudflare. It's an interesting read that shows some good troubleshooting as well as some information on how Cloudflare's OWASP rules work.
