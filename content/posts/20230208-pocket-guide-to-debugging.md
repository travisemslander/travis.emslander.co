I came across this funny little comic book about debugging called [The Pocket Guide to Debugging](https://wizardzines.com/zines/debugging-guide/) by Julia Evans. I thought this little book is great. It's not only funny, but it's actually really great advice on how to debug problems. It's full of a lot of best practices I've used and coached people on over the years, as well as a few I'll definitely start recommending.
