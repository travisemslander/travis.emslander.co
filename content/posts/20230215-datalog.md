I recently read this [explainer on Datalog](https://blogit.michelin.io/an-introduction-to-datalog/). I've never actually heard of this alternate query language. It is pretty interesting, and a couple of the use cases seem like they'd be great ways to represent comment network questions we have. However, I wasn't clear by the end of the article where this can be used, and it noted that there are often performance issues in application of it which made me instantly much less interseted.
