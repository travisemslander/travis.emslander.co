Chrome canary builds now have a new "anchor" concept for CSS positioning which should be in future versions of Chrome. There is also development on a polyfill. This is interesting because it can be quite complex and difficult to reliably get positioning of an element based on another element. [This article announcing this new feature goes into details](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/tether-elements-to-each-other-with-css-anchor-positioning/) on the current methodology and what the new anchor method is.
