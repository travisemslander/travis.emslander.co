Not all engineers are aware, but floating points are attempts at representing a fraction in binary. They are often not able to be an exact representation of the number and are as close an approximation as can be achieved. This leads to lots of potential issues when doing math with floating points, as most of the engineers on the WOOP team who have tried summing our pay accounting table (also why we never should use floating points for financial purposes). I ran across [this really nice writeup on various horror stories people have had come up with floating point numbers](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/01/13/examples-of-floating-point-problems/). It's a great read to learn from others mistakes and hopefully avoid some of these pitfalls yourself.
