I ran across <a href=https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/01/13/examples-of-floating-point-problems/>this really nice writeup on various horror stories people have had come up with floating point numbers</a>. It&rsquo;s a great read to learn from others mistakes and hopefully avoid some of these pitfalls yourself.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
